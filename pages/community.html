        <h2>Swinburne Hellenic Society</h2> <!----------------------------------------------------->
		<p>
        Having a passion for exploring new cultures and traditions, I was an active member of the
        <a href="https://studentlife.swinburne.edu.au/Clubs/swinhellenicsociety" target="_blank">
        University Greek Club</a> during my final years at university. I progressed from a general
        committee member to the executive committee as the Treasurer. Despite not having a Greek
        background, I was entrusted by the community to hold this title and fulfil the associated
        responsibilities.
        <br><br>
        During my six months as Treasurer, I contributed to organising events, managing club
        finances, and promoting Greek culture within the university. This opportunity allowed me to
        meet many wonderful individuals, not just from my university but from across Melbourne, as
        our club is affiliated with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nugasvic/" target="_blank">
        NUGAS</a>. I had an incredible time learning about Greek culture and embraced every
        opportunity to enjoy Souvlaki.

		<h2>In2Science</h2> <!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
		<p>
        I have always been passionate about math and I believe that anyone can engage with it given
        the right guidance. This belief motivated me to volunteer as a maths mentor with the
        <a href="https://in2science.org.au" target="_blank"> In2Science</a> programme in 2022 and
        2023. I worked with Year 10 students, helping them grasp mathematical concepts and providing
        insight into what itâ€™s like to study STEM at university.
        <br><br>
        Many people are put off by math because they perceive it as merely a "subject of numbers,"
        which I find quite unfortunate. When viewed as a "language of logic," it becomes
        significantly more engaging. I have tried to share this perspective with my students, and it
        has been rewarding to witness their growing enjoyment of the language. Additionally, it was
        a lovely to be nominated for Best Mentor in 2022 and to be a finalist for Best Communicator
        in 2023.

        <h2>Sweebs Club</h2> <!-------------------------------------------------------------------->
        <p>
        Starting university during COVID was rather disappointing, particularly as the first year is
        typically a time for meeting new people. However, with online classes and limited
        socialising, I was determined not to miss out on the opportunity. Consequently, I decided to
        establish a new university club called Sweebs, which focused on Asian animated entertainment,
        including Japanese and Korean comics, cartoons, J-pop, and K-pop.
        <br><br>
        As I began this venture, I realised that the club could be more than just a niche interest
        group. I recognised that all university students were likely seeking ways to connect with
        one another, even while we were confined to online interactions. Therefore, I shifted the
        focus to creating a social space for students to gather and network.
        <br><br>
        This approach proved to be highly successful, and we grew to over 400 members in just a few
        months. It became one of the largest university clubs at the time, and it was wonderful to
        see individuals from across the university coming together. I also initiated an "all
        committee community" to facilitate collaboration among different clubs for events. It was a
        straightforward idea, but it turned out to be a significant success, with representatives
        from over 20 clubs participating and working together within just a month - that was, for as
        long as I was incharge.

        <h2>Round Square: Eye Camp</h2> <!--------------------------------------------------------->
        <p>
        In my final year of high school, I participated in a volunteer programme organised by
        <a href="https://www.roundsquare.org" target="_blank">Round Square</a>, which involved
        travelling to underprivileged areas in India. Our mission was to raise awareness about eye
        health and provide free eye tests and glasses to those in need. Prior to our work, we
        received training from professionals on how to conduct eye tests, which was an invaluable
        experience.
        <br><br>
        It was eye-opening to witness how many individuals were struggling with blurry vision, often
        unaware that it was a treatable condition. We were able to make a significant difference by
        offering free eye tests and glasses to those who required them. It was a deeply rewarding
        experience that has stayed with me.
        <br><br>
        The programme was a tremendous success, garnering considerable local attention and media
        coverage. Local news agencies even came to document our efforts, and I was fortunate enough
        to be featured in one of the articles. Below is a section from the local newspaper that
        highlights our experience.
