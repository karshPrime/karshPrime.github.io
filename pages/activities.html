        <h2>Swinburne Hellenic Society</h2> <!-------------------------------------------------->
		<p>
        I'm the Treasurer of my university's 
                <a href="https://studentlife.swinburne.edu.au/Clubs/swinhellenicsociety"
            target="_blank"> Greek club</a> , which might seem like an unexpected role for
        someone who isn't Greek themselves. But I've always been drawn to learning about
        different cultures, and the Greek community at my uni has been incredibly
        welcoming. I've had the chance to get involved and learn more about the culture,
        and now I'm part of the executive committee. It's a great way for me to contribute
        and be a part of something that's all about sharing and celebrating Greek
        heritage.

		<h2>In2Science</h2> <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
		<p>
        I've always been passionate about maths, and I believe that anyone can get into it
        with the right guidance. That's why I volunteered as a maths mentor with the
        <a href="https://in2science.org.au" target="_blank"> In2Science</a> program in
        2021 and 2022. I worked with grade 10 students, helping them understand maths
        concepts and giving them a glimpse into what it's like to study STEM at
        university.
        <br>
        I think a lot of people get turned off maths because they see it as a "subject of
        numbers," but I think that's a shame. When you start to see maths as a "language
        of logic," it becomes a lot more interesting. I've tried to pass on that
        perspective to my students, and it's been great to see them start to enjoy maths
        more. It was also a nice bonus to be nominated for Best Mentor in 2021 and to be a
        finalist for Best Communicator in 2022.
