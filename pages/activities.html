        <h2>Swinburne Hellenic Society</h2> <!-------------------------------------------------->
		<p>
        I'm serving as the Treasurer of my university's
        <a href="https://studentlife.swinburne.edu.au/Clubs/swinhellenicsociety"
            target="_blank"> Greek club</a>.
        <br><br>
         It’s always a joy to discover a new culture, especially when it’s shared by
         people who are truly passionate about it. I’m not Greek, and my first experience
         with "anything Greek" was actually through my Physics classes. However, I’ve had
         the chance to learn about the culture from a wonderfully inclusive community. 
         <br><br>
         I have now been promoted to the executive committee of the Greek club, which
         gives me an even greater opportunity to contribute and engage with this vibrant
         culture.

		<h2>In2Science</h2> <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
		<p>
		I participated as a Mathematics mentor in the <a href="https://in2science.org.au"
			target="_blank"> In2Science</a> program during 2021 and 2022, where I guided grade 10
		students in understanding mathematics and provided insights into university life,
		particularly in the field of STEM. 
        <br><br>
		In 2021, I was honored to be nominated for Best Mentor, and in 2022, I was a finalist for
		Best Communicator.
