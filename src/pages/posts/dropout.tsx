                Dreaming of being an innovator - leaving a difference in the
                world as the mark of my living - I felt studying Innovation and
                Entrepreneurship made most sense as I neared graduation as an
                engineer. I knew <b>how to build</b>; now I needed to learn{" "}
                <b>what to build</b>. Being admitted to Babson College felt like
                a dream come true. Babson has been ranked #1 for
                Entrepreneurship for 32 years and being accepted with the{" "}
                <b>Impact Award</b> made the path ahead seem clear.

                Boston it is. I moved to the U.S. at the end of July and took
                time to get involved with local culture and communities. I went
                to meetups for business owners, biotech people, startup
                founders, physicists, historians and others. I met many people
                doing what I hope to do. With an automotive business idea in
                mind, I also surveyed people around the city to validate my
                problem statement - to check if my idea addressed a genuine
                need. That exposed me to even more professionals and to their
                views on technology, but as consumers.
              </p>
              <p>
                All this made me question whether the classroom was the best
                place for me right now. I was still only doing prerequisite
                courses for my M.S., so I could have waited and settled into the
                “life of a grad student” and let the question blur. But would
                that have been right?
              </p>
              <p>
                While I was fretting, I asked a friend for her advice - she was
                starting grad school at Babson too. Waiting for her in the city
                garden, I came across a U.S. Marine Corps 250‑year celebration.
                I idled in the garden and wandered the stalls, talking with
                servicemen and officers. I ended up speaking to a Marine Corps
                sergeant who suggested I could join and, with my qualifications
                as a graduate engineer, be tested for an officer role. I hadn’t
                even cleared eligibility yet (which I later did), but being
                offered that possibility was striking… especially since I was
                already on the fence about dropping out.
              </p>
              <p>
                Talking with those people, it was clear, I wanted to enter the
                professional world and do something that mattered. Something
                meaningful. Something greater than myself. A typical office job
                wouldn’t give me this satisfaction, but neither would sitting in
                a classroom researching hypothetical cases for assignments.

                Engineering is what I love. Engineer is who I am. Continuing the
                course felt like putting a “halt” on my passion. Many people I
                met, including the sergeant, argued that entrepreneurial and
                leadership skills can be learned more effectively through
                experience than only through formal education.
              </p>
              <p>
                Deciding to leave Babson was not easy. Accepting it was even
                harder. It felt right to move forward. I didn’t have the luxury
                of time to prepare mentally for either path, but I did have all
                the facts.

                Returning to Australia and stepping into the professional world
                feels better. It’s hard to describe - there’s a quiet comfort to
                the decision. Australia felt more like home, though with my
                short time in Boston I had already begun to feel at home there
                too. MIT has a beautiful campus; I can imagine being a PhD
                candidate there one day, perhaps plan my retirement as a
                researcher there, but that’s far ahead and not my immediate
                concern.
              </p>
              <p>
                The satisfaction of being part of something greater than
                yourself — that’s what drew me to consider the Marines full
                time. I’m still young and have my whole life ahead of me; now
                feels like a good time to take the first step.
