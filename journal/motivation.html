        As we navigate an era defined by rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics,
        the role of humans in the workforce is increasingly called into question. Many people
        express concern about the potential for robots to replace human jobs, but I believe the
        underlying issue is more complex than mere job displacement.
        <br><br>
        Take factory workers, for instance. If it weren't for the financial necessity of their jobs,
        many would likely welcome robots taking over their roles. The fear surrounding automation
        isn't about the technology itself; it's about the loss of income that comes with losing a
        job. Workers are not inherently afraid of AI; they are concerned about how losing their jobs
        would impact their ability to pay bills and support their families.
        <br><br>
        This brings us to a critical point: if robots can perform all repetitive tasks, we should
        reconsider our economic model. Instead of viewing automation as a threat, we could envision
        a future where machines handle essential work- like farming and manufacturing, providing
        goods such as food and shelter at little to no cost. In this scenario, money could become
        less of a necessity, and more of a luxury, allowing people to focus on pursuits that truly
        matter to them.
        <br><br>
        While this may sound too idealistic, it reflects a fundamental principle: we have the
        opportunity to utilise technology to improve human life. This belief is what drives my
        ambition to create digital solutions, particularly in the field of prosthetics.
        <br><br>
        Currently, many individuals with disabilities face significant challenges in accessing
        affordable and effective prosthetic solutions. For those in remote areas, even basic
        maintenance of their devices can be a struggle. Unfortunately, advanced technology is often
        out of reach for those who need it the most. I envision a future where innovative prosthetic
        solutions are accessible to everyone, enabling individuals to lead more independent lives
        without the burden of financial constraints.
        <br><br>
        This vision may seem ambitious, but it highlights the potential of technology to reshape our
        lives. By embracing AI and robotics, we can explore new ways to address fundamental human
        needs, such as accessibility and independence. The possibilities are vast, and they extend
        beyond mere efficiency; they offer a chance to rethink how we structure our society and
        economy.
        <br><br>
        As an engineer, I am particularly interested in how these advancements can be applied to
        improve the lives of individuals with disabilities. While my focus is not solely on my
        personal journey, I recognise the importance of contributing to this conversation. I aim to
        play a role in developing innovative solutions that make prosthetics more accessible and
        effective for those who need them. In doing so, I hope to be part of a broader movement that
        embraces the potential of technology to enhance human life.
