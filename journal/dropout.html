        Dreaming of being an innovator - leaving a difference in the world as the mark of my living
        - I felt studying Innovation and Entrepreneurship made most sense as I neared graduation as
        an engineer. I knew <b>how to build</b>; now I needed to learn <b>what to build</b>. Being
        admitted to Babson College felt like a dream come true. Babson has been ranked #1 for
        Entrepreneurship for 32 years and being accepted with the <b>Impact Award</b> made the path
        ahead seem clear.
        <br><br>
        Boston it is. I moved to the U.S. at the end of July and took time to get involved with
        local culture and communities. I went to meetups for business owners, biotech people,
        startup founders, physicists, historians and others. I met many people doing what I hope to
        do. With an automotive business idea in mind, I also surveyed people around the city to
        validate my problem statement - to check if my idea addressed a genuine need. That exposed
        me to even more professionals and to their views on technology, but as consumers.
        <br><br>
        All this made me question whether the classroom was the best place for me right now. I was
        still only doing prerequisite courses for my M.S., so I could have waited and settled into
        the “life of a grad student” and let the question blur. But would that have been right?
        <br><br>
        While I was fretting, I asked a friend for her advice - she was starting grad school at
        Babson too. Waiting for her in the city garden, I came across a U.S. Marine Corps 250‑year
        celebration. I idled in the garden and wandered the stalls, talking with servicemen and
        officers. I ended up speaking to a Marine Corps sergeant who suggested I could join and,
        with my qualifications as a graduate engineer, be tested for an officer role. I hadn’t even
        cleared eligibility yet (which I later did), but being offered that possibility was
        striking… especially since I was already on the fence about dropping out.
        <br><br>
        Talking with those people, it was clear, I wanted to enter the professional world and do
        something that mattered. Something meaningful. Something greater than myself. A typical
        office job wouldn’t give me this satisfaction, but neither would sitting in a classroom
        researching hypothetical cases for assignments.
        <br><br>
        Engineering is what I love. Engineer is who I am. Continuing the course felt like putting a
        “halt” on my passion. Many people I met, including the sergeant, argued that entrepreneurial
        and leadership skills can be learned more effectively through experience than only through
        formal education.
        <br><br>
        Deciding to leave Babson was not easy. Accepting it was even harder. It felt right to move
        forward. I didn’t have the luxury of time to prepare mentally for either path, but I did
        have all the facts.
        <br><br>
        Returning to Australia and stepping into the professional world feels better. It’s hard to
        describe - there’s a quiet comfort to the decision. Australia felt more like home, though
        with my short time in Boston I had already begun to feel at home there too. MIT has a
        beautiful campus; I can imagine being a PhD candidate there one day, perhaps plan my
        retirement as a researcher there, but that’s far ahead and not my immediate concern.
        <br><br>
        The satisfaction of being part of something greater than yourself — that’s what drew me to
        consider the Marines full time. I’m still young and have my whole life ahead of me; now
        feels like a good time to take the first step.
